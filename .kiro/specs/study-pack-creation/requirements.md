# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the Study Pack Creation feature for Sappio V2, which encompasses material upload, processing, and AI-powered study pack generation. The feature enables users to upload learning materials (PDF, DOCX, images, URLs, YouTube videos) and automatically generates comprehensive study packs containing smart notes, flashcards, quizzes, and mind maps. This is the core value proposition of Sappio: "Upload once â†’ get everything to learn."

The system must process materials within 60 seconds to meet the "exam-ready in <60s" promise, while respecting plan-based usage limits (Free: 3 packs/month with 25 cards/pack; Student Pro: 300 packs/month with 300 cards/pack; Pro+: higher caps with bulk upload).

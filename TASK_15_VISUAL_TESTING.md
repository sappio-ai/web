# Task 15 - Visual Testing Guide

## üé® What You Should See in the Browser

### Test 1: Accessing Dashboard Without Login

**Action:** Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` (while logged out)

**What happens:**
1. Browser URL changes to: `http://localhost:3000/login?redirectTo=/dashboard`
2. You see the **Login Page** with:
   - Welcome Orb (friendly wave)
   - Email input field
   - Password input field
   - "Sign in with Google" button
   - "Forgot password?" link
   - Link to signup page

**Visual Indicator:** The URL bar shows the redirect parameter, proving the middleware caught your attempt to access a protected route.

---

### Test 2: Logging In Successfully

**Action:** Enter valid credentials and click "Sign In"

**What happens:**
1. Processing Orb appears (thinking pose)
2. Form submits to `/api/auth/login`
3. On success, you're redirected to `/dashboard`
4. You see the **Dashboard Page** with:
   - "Welcome back, [Your Name]!" heading
   - Three stat cards (Study Materials, Study Packs, Quizzes)
   - Getting Started section with 3 steps
   - Debug info (in development mode) showing your email, user ID, and plan

**Visual Indicator:** The URL is now `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` and you can see your personalized dashboard.

---

### Test 3: Trying to Access Login While Logged In

**Action:** While logged in, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login`

**What happens:**
1. Middleware detects you're already authenticated
2. Browser immediately redirects to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
3. You never see the login page

**Visual Indicator:** The URL changes from `/login` to `/dashboard` almost instantly (you might see a brief flash).

---

### Test 4: Session Persistence (Page Refresh)

**Action:** While on the dashboard, press F5 or Ctrl+R to refresh

**What happens:**
1. Page reloads
2. Middleware checks your session
3. Session is still valid
4. Dashboard loads normally
5. You remain logged in

**Visual Indicator:** No redirect to login page. Dashboard loads with all your data intact.

---

### Test 5: Logging Out

**Action:** Click the logout button (when implemented) or manually call the logout API

**What happens:**
1. Session is cleared
2. Cookies are deleted
3. You're redirected to `/login`
4. If you try to access `/dashboard` now, you'll be redirected to `/login`

**Visual Indicator:** You're back at the login page and can no longer access protected routes.

---

## üîç Browser DevTools Inspection

### Checking Cookies (When Logged In)

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Click **Cookies** ‚Üí `http://localhost:3000`
4. You should see cookies like:
   ```
   sb-catwozixwjrwzzzibqfb-auth-token
   sb-catwozixwjrwzzzibqfb-auth-token-code-verifier
   ```

**Visual Indicator:** These cookies contain your session data. If they're missing, you're not logged in.

### Checking Network Requests

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Navigate to `/dashboard` while logged out
4. You should see:
   ```
   Request URL: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   Status Code: 307 Temporary Redirect
   Location: /login?redirectTo=/dashboard
   ```

**Visual Indicator:** The 307 redirect proves the middleware is working before the page even loads.

### Checking Console for Errors

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for any red error messages
4. If everything is working, you should see minimal logs

**Visual Indicator:** No authentication errors means the middleware is working correctly.

## üì± Mobile Testing (Optional)

The middleware works the same on mobile browsers:

1. Open your phone's browser
2. Navigate to `http://[your-local-ip]:3000/dashboard`
3. Same redirect behavior should occur
4. Session persistence works across mobile refreshes

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You'll know the middleware is working correctly when:

- ‚úÖ You **cannot** access `/dashboard`, `/profile`, or `/settings` without logging in
- ‚úÖ You **are** automatically redirected to `/login` when trying to access protected routes
- ‚úÖ You **cannot** access `/login` or `/signup` when already logged in
- ‚úÖ You **are** automatically redirected to `/dashboard` when trying to access auth pages while logged in
- ‚úÖ Your session **persists** across page refreshes
- ‚úÖ The `redirectTo` parameter **works** (after login, you're sent to the page you originally tried to access)

## üéØ Quick Test Checklist

Use this checklist to verify everything works:

- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard` while logged out ‚Üí Redirects to `/login`
- [ ] Log in with valid credentials ‚Üí Redirects to `/dashboard`
- [ ] Refresh the dashboard page ‚Üí Stays on dashboard (no redirect)
- [ ] Navigate to `/login` while logged in ‚Üí Redirects to `/dashboard`
- [ ] Navigate to `/signup` while logged in ‚Üí Redirects to `/dashboard`
- [ ] Log out ‚Üí Redirects to `/login`
- [ ] Try to access `/dashboard` after logout ‚Üí Redirects to `/login`
- [ ] Check cookies in DevTools ‚Üí Session cookies present when logged in
- [ ] Check Network tab ‚Üí See 307 redirects for protected routes when logged out

## üêõ Common Issues and Visual Indicators

### Issue: Infinite Redirect Loop
**Visual:** Browser keeps redirecting between pages rapidly, URL keeps changing
**Solution:** Check middleware configuration, ensure matcher excludes API routes

### Issue: Not Redirecting at All
**Visual:** You can access `/dashboard` without logging in
**Solution:** Middleware might not be running. Check `src/middleware.ts` exists and is properly configured

### Issue: Redirecting Too Much
**Visual:** Even logged in, you get redirected to login
**Solution:** Session might be invalid. Clear cookies and log in again

### Issue: Slow Redirects
**Visual:** You see the protected page briefly before redirect
**Solution:** This is normal for client-side checks. Middleware should catch it server-side first

## üé¨ Video Testing Flow (Recommended)

Record your screen while testing to verify the flow:

1. **Start logged out** ‚Üí Navigate to `/dashboard`
2. **See redirect** ‚Üí URL changes to `/login?redirectTo=/dashboard`
3. **Log in** ‚Üí Enter credentials and submit
4. **See dashboard** ‚Üí Redirected to `/dashboard` with your data
5. **Refresh page** ‚Üí Dashboard reloads, still logged in
6. **Try to access login** ‚Üí Immediately redirected back to `/dashboard`
7. **Log out** ‚Üí Redirected to `/login`
8. **Try dashboard again** ‚Üí Redirected to `/login`

This complete flow proves the middleware is working end-to-end.

## üìä Expected vs Actual Results

| Test | Expected URL | Expected Page | Expected Behavior |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Access `/dashboard` (logged out) | `/login?redirectTo=/dashboard` | Login page | Immediate redirect |
| Access `/login` (logged in) | `/dashboard` | Dashboard | Immediate redirect |
| Refresh `/dashboard` (logged in) | `/dashboard` | Dashboard | No redirect |
| Access `/dashboard` (after logout) | `/login?redirectTo=/dashboard` | Login page | Immediate redirect |

# Profile Page Fixes - Complete ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Username Editing Issue
**Problem**: Users couldn't edit their username (e.g., changing "hey" to "pey") because the code was preventing any character deletion.

**Solution**: Removed the `handleChange` restriction that prevented editing. Users can now freely edit their username, including deleting characters.

### 2. ✅ Username Validation
**Problem**: Need to prevent saving an empty username once it's been set.

**Solution**: Added validation in `validateForm()` that checks:
- If a username already exists in the profile (`profile?.username`)
- And the form data username is empty (`!formData.username`)
- Then show error: "Username cannot be empty once set"

This allows:
- ✅ Users to freely edit their username (delete/add characters)
- ✅ Users to save changes to their username
- ❌ Users cannot save an empty username if one already exists

### 3. ✅ Alert Persistence Issue
**Problem**: The "Complete Your Profile" alert stayed visible after setting username until page refresh.

**Solution**: 
- Added `hasUsername` state that tracks whether user has a username
- Updated this state in `handleSubmit` when username is successfully saved:
  ```typescript
  if (formData.username && !hasUsername) {
    setHasUsername(true)
  }
  ```
- The alert now disappears immediately after saving username without needing a refresh

### 4. ✅ Removed Email Status
**Problem**: Email status was showing in Account Info sidebar.

**Solution**: Removed the "Email Status: Verified" row from the Account Info card. Now only shows "Member Since" date.

### 5. ✅ Code Cleanup
**Problem**: Unused imports and variables causing warnings.

**Solution**: Removed:
- Unused imports: `Globe`, `X`, `ChevronDown`
- Unused state: `dropdownOpen`, `setDropdownOpen`
- Unused ref: `dropdownRef`
- Unused variables: `languages`, `selectedLanguage`
- Unused useEffect for dropdown click outside handler

## Technical Details

### Validation Logic
```typescript
const validateForm = () => {
  const newErrors: Record<string, string> = {}

  // Prevent saving empty username if one already exists
  if (profile?.username && !formData.username) {
    newErrors.username = 'Username cannot be empty once set'
  }

  // Other validations...
  if (formData.username && formData.username.length < 3) {
    newErrors.username = 'Username must be at least 3 characters'
  }

  if (formData.username && !/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/.test(formData.username)) {
    newErrors.username = 'Username can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores'
  }

  setErrors(newErrors)
  return Object.keys(newErrors).length === 0
}
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Track username status
const [hasUsername, setHasUsername] = useState(initialHasUsername)

// Update on successful save
if (formData.username && !hasUsername) {
  setHasUsername(true)
}
```

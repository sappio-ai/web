# Task 4 Complete: UsageService Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented the complete UsageService for plan limit enforcement in the Sappio V2 study pack creation feature.

## What Was Done

### Task 3.3 (Verified Complete)
- âœ… Confirmed MaterialService already has `getUserMaterialCount` and `getCurrentMonthMaterialCount` methods

### Task 4.1: Database Schema
Created comprehensive usage tracking system with migration:

**New Tables:**
- `plan_limits` - Configurable limits for each plan tier (free, student_pro, pro_plus)
- `usage_counters` - Fast lookup table for usage within billing periods
- `usage_idempotency` - Prevents duplicate counting on retries/network failures

**User Table Updates:**
- Added `billing_anchor` column (1-28, day of month when billing cycle starts)
- Added `timezone` column (for accurate period calculations)

**Database Function:**
- `increment_usage_counter()` - Atomically increments pack count with idempotency protection

**Default Plan Limits Inserted:**
- Free: 3 packs/month, 25 cards, 10 quiz questions, 50 pages, 50k tokens, 20 mindmap nodes
- Student Pro: 300 packs/month, 300 cards, 30 quiz questions, 200 pages, 200k tokens, 100 mindmap nodes
- Pro Plus: 1000 packs/month, 500 cards, 50 quiz questions, 500 pages, 500k tokens, 200 mindmap nodes

### Task 4.2: Core UsageService Methods
Created `src/lib/services/UsageService.ts` with:
- `getPlanLimits()` - Fetches plan limits with 5-minute caching
- `calculatePeriodStart()` - Calculates billing period start based on user's billing anchor
- `calculatePeriodEnd()` - Calculates billing period end date
- `getUsageForPeriod()` - Gets current usage count for a billing period
- `getUserProfile()` - Fetches user with plan information

### Task 4.3: Quota Checking and Consumption
Added quota management methods:
- `canCreatePack()` - Checks if user can create a pack (includes grace window logic)
- `consumePackQuota()` - Atomically consumes quota with idempotency protection
- `getUsageStats()` - Returns detailed usage statistics with percentages and warnings

**Grace Window Feature:**
- Users get 1 extra pack beyond their limit for better conversion
- 80% threshold warning for approaching limit

### Task 4.4: Helper Methods and Utilities
Added utility methods:
- `checkQuotaWarning()` - Quick check for quota warnings
- `logUsageEvent()` - Logs usage events to analytics
- `getAllPlanLimits()` - Fetches all plan limits for comparison
- `clearCache()` - Clears plan limits cache

### Type Definitions
Created `src/lib/types/usage.ts` with:
- `PlanTier` type
- `PlanLimits` interface
- `UsageCounter` interface
- `UsageStats` interface
- `UserProfile` interface
- `DEFAULT_PLAN_LIMITS` constant as fallback

## Key Features

1. **Idempotency Protection**: Prevents double-counting on retries or network failures
2. **Atomic Operations**: Uses PostgreSQL function for race-condition-free counting
3. **Caching**: 5-minute cache for plan limits to reduce database queries
4. **Grace Window**: Allows 1 extra pack for better user experience
5. **Flexible Billing**: Supports custom billing anchor dates (1-28)
6. **Timezone Support**: Accurate period calculations based on user timezone
7. **Warning System**: 80% threshold warning before hitting limit

## Database Verification

Verified all tables and data:
```sql
SELECT * FROM plan_limits;
-- Returns 3 rows: free, student_pro, pro_plus with correct limits
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/lib/types/usage.ts` - Type definitions
- `src/lib/services/UsageService.ts` - Complete service implementation

### Database:
- Migration: `create_usage_tracking_system` - All schema changes

## No Errors

All TypeScript files compile without errors or warnings.

## How to Test

### 1. Check Plan Limits
```typescript
import { UsageService } from '@/lib/services/UsageService'

const limits = await UsageService.getPlanLimits('free')
console.log(limits) // { packsPerMonth: 3, cardsPerPack: 25, ... }
```

### 2. Check User Quota
```typescript
const canCreate = await UsageService.canCreatePack(userId)
if (canCreate.allowed) {
  console.log('User can create pack')
  console.log('Usage:', canCreate.usage)
} else {
  console.log('Quota exceeded:', canCreate.reason)
}
```

### 3. Consume Quota
```typescript
const result = await UsageService.consumePackQuota(userId, 'unique-key-123')
console.log('New count:', result.newCount)
console.log('Usage stats:', result.usage)
```

### 4. Get Usage Stats
```typescript
const stats = await UsageService.getUsageStats(userId)
console.log(`Used ${stats.currentUsage}/${stats.limit} (${stats.percentUsed}%)`)
console.log(`Remaining: ${stats.remaining}`)
console.log(`Near limit: ${stats.isNearLimit}`)
```

## Next Steps

Task 5 will implement the file upload API endpoint that uses this UsageService to enforce plan limits during material upload.

## Testing in UI

Currently, this is backend infrastructure. It will be testable in the UI once:
1. Task 5 (file upload API) is complete
2. Task 18 (CreatePackModal component) is complete

At that point, you'll be able to:
- Upload materials and see quota enforcement
- See warning messages at 80% usage
- Experience the grace window (1 extra pack)
- See upgrade prompts when limit is reached

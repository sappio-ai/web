## Orb Avatar Strategy

The Sappio Orb is the friendly face of the app and should appear throughout the user journey:

**Core Principles:**
- Orb reflects user emotions and app states
- Consistent character but adaptable to context
- Soft, friendly, encouraging personality
- Never judgmental or negative
- Celebrates wins, supports struggles

**Pose Categories:**
1. **Emotional States:** Happy, excited, thinking, confused, tired, celebrating
2. **Actions:** Reading, studying, teaching, analyzing, organizing, creating
3. **Contexts:** Upload, processing, learning, testing, exporting, admin
4. **Accessories:** Glasses, hat, crown, tools, badges, subject-specific items
5. **Backgrounds:** Subject themes, mood lighting, contextual environments

**Technical Implementation:**
- AI-generate 50+ static pose variations
- Optimize as WebP with lazy loading
- Preload critical poses (dashboard, upload, processing)
- Simple image swaps between poses (no animations)
- Provide alt text for accessibility

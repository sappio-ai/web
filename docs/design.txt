Sappio should feel like opening a neat stack of study papers on a clean desk.

Everything is bright, structured, and calm. The interface feels purpose-built for documents and learning, not like a generic dashboard. The “personality” comes from one repeating cue: subtle layered sheets and a small bookmark tab that quietly signals what’s important.

Overall vibe
	•	Academic and trustworthy: crisp whites, ink-like text, clear hierarchy.
	•	Premium and tactile: cards feel like paper sheets, not floating glass panels.
	•	Friendly but not childish: the mascot is supportive, small, and calm. The UI stays serious.

No glow, no neon gradients, no futuristic ornaments.

Colors

Use a cool paper base, not beige:
	•	Background: a very light cool white (paper) with a hint of blue
	•	Surfaces: pure white for the top “sheet”
	•	Ink text: near-black/navy for readability
	•	Borders: soft blue-gray lines
	•	One brand accent: your blue (#5A5FF0 or a slightly inkier variant) reserved for focus, CTAs, links, and the bookmark tab

Optional micro-accent:
	•	A muted “highlighter” yellow only for progress or tiny highlights, never large backgrounds.

The signature system: Document Stack

Every important container is a paper stack:
	•	The main card is a clean white sheet.
	•	Behind it, 1 to 2 offset sheets appear as subtle layers.
	•	Layers are created with borders and tiny offsets, not heavy shadows.

This becomes the visual identity across the whole app:
	•	login card
	•	study pack cards
	•	uploaded document tiles
	•	flashcard decks
	•	quiz modules

Bookmark Tab (your brand mark)

A tiny bookmark tab is the repeatable brand element:
	•	Appears on the top-right edge of active cards and selected items.
	•	Also appears on the mascot’s book.
	•	Same size and shape everywhere, always in brand blue.

It’s not decorative, it’s functional: “this is the current or saved thing.”

Cards

Cards must feel like paper:
	•	White surface
	•	1px border
	•	12px radius
	•	Very soft shadow only to separate from background, never dramatic

Inside cards:
	•	Clear header area
	•	Thin divider lines
	•	Consistent spacing rhythm

Buttons

Buttons feel decisive, like a clean call-to-action on a form:
	•	Primary button is solid brand blue with white text
	•	Secondary is white with a border
	•	Hover states are subtle: slight darken or slight lift
	•	Focus states are consistent across everything: a calm blue ring

No gradients, no glowing outlines.

Inputs

Inputs feel like a worksheet:
	•	White background
	•	Clear border
	•	Strong focus border in brand blue
	•	Helpful placeholder contrast (not washed out)
	•	Labels small and confident, not faint

Typography

Typography does most of the heavy lifting:
	•	Headings are tight and confident (Inter Tight or similar)
	•	Body is neutral and highly readable (Inter)
	•	Clear hierarchy and spacing, like an editorial layout

Layout and spacing

The layout is simple and intentional:
	•	Big whitespace around the left story column
	•	The right card is the “top sheet”
	•	The left column supports: mascot, headline, “how it works” as short steps

Everything aligns to a clean grid and uses thin dividers instead of decoration.

Mascot usage

The porcelain reading mascot fits perfectly here:
	•	Small, calm, matte
	•	No glow
	•	Used sparingly as a friendly anchor, not as the main brand identity
	•	The blue bookmark on the book ties it directly into the UI system

This design stands out because it looks like a real study tool built around documents, with a recognizable “stack + bookmark” language that you can repeat everywhere
